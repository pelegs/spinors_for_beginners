# SPINORS FOR BEGINNERS - The free and open source book
This is a repository for a completely FREE and open source book about the mathematics (and some usage of) spinors. It is based with permission on the [phenomenal playlist by Eigenchris](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJHszsWbB6hoOo_wMb0b6T44KM_ABZtBs&si=r-SzgR3AvDyEkNXU) (NOTE: still WIP).

The general structure of the book is planned to be as followed:

#### Part A: General background topics
1. Linear algebra
2. Geometric algebra
3. Groups, rings, algebras (abstract mathematics)
4. Lie groups and Lie algberas

#### Part B: Five levels of spinors
1. Motivation and examples
2. Spinors as square roots of vectors
3. Clifford algebras
4. Lie groups and algebras
5. Spinors in particle physics

More information will come soon.
