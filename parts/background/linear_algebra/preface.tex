\section{Preface}
\newthought{The goal of this chapter} is to review a few of the more advanced topics in linear algebra, which are important both for learning the other background topics, as well as the actual topic of spinors.

For example, the topic of dual vectors can help with understanding the what the Dira/bra-ket notation actually means, and cement a deeper understanding of the basic ideas of quantum physics. The topic of absrtact vector spaces provides a good foundation for topics such as geometric- and abstract algebra.
